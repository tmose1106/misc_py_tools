Miscellanous tools written in Python for a series of tasks

== Background

On June 9th, 2016, I deleted many useful tools that I had been using for some
time. This repo is dedicated to those scripts which were so helpful to me. I
am in the process of recreating them. They will be available on GitHub so that
I will never lose them again, and so that anyone can take advantage of them.

== License
These scripts are all available under the MIT Open Source license.
